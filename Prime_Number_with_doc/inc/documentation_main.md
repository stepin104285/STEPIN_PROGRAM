@mainpage PRIME NUMBER CODE 
1.A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
2.A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number. For example, 5 is prime because the only ways of writing it as a product, 1 × 5 or 5 × 1, involve 5 itself.
